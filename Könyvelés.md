## week 4
* Set up Unity and Visual Studio for the project
* Made some pixel and character art for the game
* Some debugging in Visual Studio
* Made the basic map and loaded the game objects
* Give the playable character object gravity and coliders so it can not fall out of the map and itneract with the world around it
## week 5
* Made the playable character shootable, so you can launch it towards stuff
* Give the playable character some texture changes if it's clicked on
* Give the playable character some indicators for the launching part and made it fit the screen and made it pass to the playable game object
* Some debugging in the palyable object's code
## week 6
* Added enemies and wrote them a script so they die on collision with the playable game object or getting hit on their head
* Animated some more frames for the enemies so they can blink
* Made changes in the lineart and basic look of the map
* Made a virtual camera with cinnematics that follows our cat and the enemys and adjust it according to them
* Made a particle system that pops up upon enemy death
* Some basic debbugging with some numbers and date that did not match the previous settings
    * (right now there is a bug, where if a mosue gets hit, but it's not a direct hit, it starts spinning for no reason)
